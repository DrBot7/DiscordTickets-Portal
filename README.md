# DiscordTickets Portal
[![Dependabot Status](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=eartharoid/DiscordTickets-Portal)](https://dependabot.com)

Forked from [NailaBot/Discord-chat-replica](https://github.com/NailaBot/Discord-chat-replica) because the UI is amazing.

Currently exactly the same, but it will have a completely new web server to work with [DiscordTickets](https://github.com/eartharoid/DiscordTickets).

The bot will post json data to this when a ticket is closed,
 get /:user will show all of a user's archived tickets,
 get /:user/:channel will render the archive
